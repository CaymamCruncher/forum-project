---HOW TO INSTALL---
To install the project cd into the udaci-books folder and run npm install. Once
the installation is completed type npm start and navigate to http://localhost:3000/.

---HOW TO USE---
You start the application in the home page where you can see all posts and their authors. To view a posts body and its comments click the view button on the post. If you wish to filter your posts to a specific category you can choose one of the three categories from the navbar. You can also choose to create a new post from the navbar and input a header, a body, and choose your category. Then you will be redirected to the homepage where your post will be displayed. You can also use
the upvote and downvote buttons to increase or decrease the score of the post. You
can also edit the post by clicking the edit post button. Finally you can remove posts and comments using the remove button. Enjoy the application.

---SPECIAL THANKS---
Thanks to websites like stack overflow and github I didn't have very much trouble
with this project. Also blogs like tylermcginnis's blog helped me a lot with react-router. I'd also like to thank other students who's answers from the forums
helped with certain issues. I hope you enjoy the application.
